Frozen [FZ]

QRK hashing - based on the combination of 8 random algorithms

50 FZ per block initial block reward. On average one block each 30 seconds.

First reducation of the block reward after 77777 blocks to 25 FZ. The reward
is from then on reduced each 120 blocks until it reaches at block 1049178 the 
minimum reward of 0.075 FZ. The minimum block reward will be reached at about
one year after launch. 

The total amount of FZ issued at block 1049178 is 7711961.85620 FZ. MAX-MONEY
is set to 7,777,777 FZ - no transaction can exceed this value.

After year 1 the minimum block reward of 0.075 FZ results in about 1.01% of
inflation per year (based on a 7,777,777 FZ). For the interested here the
calculation: 365 * 24 * 60 * 2 blocks/year * 0.075 FZ/block = 78840.0 FZ.
